# Project Title: Simple Petstore API Performance Testing by JMeter
## Project Name: JPetstore Octoperf
## Tests Conducted
### Load Test
Load testing was conducted to determine how the API performs under expected user loads. The test aimed to identify response times, throughput, and potential bottlenecks.

### Stress Test
Stress testing was performed to determine the API's behavior under extreme conditions. This test helps identify the point at which the API fails or experiences significant performance degradation.

### Capacity Analysis
Capacity analysis was conducted to establish the maximum number of requests the API can handle before its performance becomes unacceptable or it fails.
